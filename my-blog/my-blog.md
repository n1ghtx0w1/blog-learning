## Getting Started With Github and Jekyll THemes
 
 ---

**How I Began**
 
I was looking to create a blog style web page, and get accustomed to using Github more. I started with a simple “github blog” google search, and here we are. I figured someone may want some greater detail about this adventure.
 
I began with the [Jekyll] documentation. Then I started into youtube videos. I’ll list some of the videos at the end of this article. Those videos led me to a resource that listed out Jekyll themes [jekyllthemes.org], and Chirpy stood out to me. I began to mess with Chirpy by following the [Jekyll Theme Chirpy Starter], and again going over the [Jekyll] documentation a second time.
 
Really I want to emphasize [making a blog with Jekyll theme chirpy], because I ran into an issue.  Watching this video helped me resolve that issue. I don't recall the issue that I encountered unfortunately, but I certainly remember the video being of importance.

The docker video, [Host Your Own Blog with Jekyll, Docker, and GitHub Pages], was something I used but not exactly necessary. I enjoy using containers, but it's not a requirement to do this. I just wanted to list the video, because I found it useful. I'll add the [docker] documentation just in case anyone comes across this, and wants to dabble in that. I'm also using [docker compose], so I'll add that as well.

Finally, a big thanks to the [Jekyll Theme Chirpy] team. I really enjoy using the theme, and enjoy the work the team put into it.
